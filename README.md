# 🔐 Tor-Routed Dual-Upstream DNS-over-HTTPS Proxy
A fault tolerant DoHoT (DNS over HTTPS over Tor) docker container

---

This project sets up a Dockerized DNS proxy that routes **all DNS queries through Tor**, using **Cloudflare's .onion DoH endpoint** as the primary upstream and a **clearnet fallback** via Tor SOCKS. This enables **private, leak-resistant, encrypted DNS resolution**, even in hostile networks.

---

## 🧰 What This Stack Includes

- 🔄 **Dual upstreams**:
  - `cloudflared` → **Cloudflare’s hidden DoH resolver** (`.onion`)
  - `cloudflared` → **Clearnet Cloudflare DoH** via Tor SOCKS as fallback
- 🧅 **Full Tor routing** via a local Tor daemon
- 🧪 **Healthchecks**: Ensures both upstreams are live before marking container healthy
- 🛠️ **Custom loopback routing** (`127.0.0.2`) to isolate upstreams inside the container
- 📊 **Prometheus metrics** endpoints per upstream: `9100` (hidden) and `9200` (clearnet fallback)
- 🐳 Built with Alpine Linux for minimal image size

## 📦 Services

### `tor-dns-proxy`

This container provides encrypted DNS-over-HTTPS via Tor using [Cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/cloudflared-proxy/).

- **Primary DoH**: `.onion` DoH endpoint (Cloudflare)
- **Backup DoH**: Clearnet DoH via Tor SOCKS proxy
- **Ports Exposed (internally only)**:
  - `53/udp` – DNS (main upstream)
  - `6053/udp` – DNS (backup upstream)
  - `9100` – Metrics for primary
  - `9200` – Metrics for backup 
- **External access is easily configurable, see docker-compose.yaml for details**

## 🧪 Health Checks

Docker health checks validate DNS resolution through both upstreams every 15 seconds:

```sh
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 53 cloudflare.com A +short
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 6053 cloudflare.com A +short
